# Investigating the Allosteric Inhibition of PTP1B by a-Bisabolene via Molecular Dynamics Simulations
## Input Files
This repository contains the input structures and the configuration file used to run molecular docking of PTP1B to a-bisabolene (AB), as described within the Senior Thesis. Additionally, all MDP files with all settings used to run the MD simulations described within the report are included. All TPR files to replicate production simulations described in the report are additionally included. All data files are located in the data directory. 

## Analysis Scripts
The analysis scripts used for molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations are found within the docking_analysis and md_analysis directories, respectively. All MD analysis scripts used within this report were authored by Anika J. Friedman. The reader is recommended to reference A.J.F.â€™s original directory (https://github.com/ajfriedman22/PTP1B) for a description of the MD analysis files found within this directory.
